## Description

Briefly, Jaro-Winkler is an algorithm that quantifies the similarity between 2 strings. This implementation itself is written in C (look for the StringMetric files), but is incorporated into an iPhone app. It is described in this paper: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/Web/People/wcohen/postscript/kdd-2003-match-ws.pdf

If you prefer Wikipedia, here's a link for convenience: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance

As a side note, you'll actually see both Jaro and Jaro-Winkler implemented here.
